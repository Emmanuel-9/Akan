SET UP INSTRUCTIONS
- Create a folder for your project.
- In the folder, create a folder of "css" where "styles.css" and "bootstrap.css" files are also created.
- In "bootstrap.css", copy and paste a css file of bootstrap from bootstrap website or where you have in your 
  PC if you already downloaded it.
- A Java script folder is also created in the primary folder where the scripts.js file will be held.
- After creation of the files and folders for the projects, an empty git folder is initialized in the 
  primary folder. This is usually done in the terminal where you make sure you are located in the folder 
  after which git is initialized using the command 'git init'.

- The "styles.css", "bootstrap.css" and "scripts.css" files are always linked to the HTML file for functionality
  of the desired output.
- Always ensure changes made are always commited.
- For this project, the behavior driven development was used in testing how the input given would be processed
  to give the desired output.
- For this type of development, there are certain rules usually considered:
   1. The behavior that we will need to write code to handle. 
   2. A sample of input that would be demonstrate the behavior.
   3. Expected output that we would get when code is working correctly.
